# The Zoom Book Club
Book Club Details

With COVID-19 a lot of people are stuck at home and we thought with the extra time we could try something fun and social. 

This book club is very much whatever we want to make of it and not meant to be extra work or stress. The goal is to read something interesting and get the chance to discuss it with friends. The plan is to meet over zoom for roughly 1 hour with the specific details being determined by poll.
